# House Price Estimator
# Overview
- A machine learning project to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities.
- Implements a Linear Regression model for prediction.
- Includes data visualization to analyze price distribution and feature importance.

# Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and encoding (e.g., pd.get_dummies)
- Train-test split for evaluation
- Linear Regression model training
- Performance evaluation using RMSE and R² Score


# Tech Stack
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

# Results
- Model evaluation using metrics like:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- Visualizations show the distribution of house prices and impact of key features.
